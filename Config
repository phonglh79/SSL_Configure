Enable HTTP/2 on Nginx
The first step in tuning Nginx for faster ttfb/latency with https is to make sure HTTP/2 is enabled. HTTP/2 was first implemented in Nginx version 1.9.5 to replace spdy. Enabling the HTTP/2 module on Nginx is simple. We just need to add the word http2 in the server block of our Nginx config file (ex. /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/sitename). (Remember: HTTP/2 requires https)

Look for this line:

listen 443 ssl;
change it to:

listen 443 ssl http2;
That’s it!
